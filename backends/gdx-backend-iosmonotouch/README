== IKVM ==
The libs/ folder contains precompiled assemblies and executables for mono. These can be build
by following the instructions at https://github.com/samskivert/ikvm-monotouch. The one's in
SVN should be good enough for now.

== How to develop ==
After checking out the libgdx source, execute ant in gdx-backends-iosmonotouch/. This will 
generate libs/gdx.dll and libs/gdx-backend-ios.dll necessary for the MonoTouch project in mono/.

The development cycle should look like this from now on:

1) Open Eclipse and import the gdx, gdx-jnigen and gdx-backends-iosmonotouch projects.
2) Open MonoDevelop and open the solution in the gdx-backens-iosmonotouch/mono folder.
3) Everytime you make changes to the gdx-backends-iosmonotouch project (add a new Java class, change a class)
   you have to execute ant:
    
	   ant -f build.xml compile-backend
	   
   This will only compile the backend and shouldn't take long. It updates the libs/gdx-backend-ios.dll.
   To test your changes go to MonoDevelop and rebuild and run your app.
